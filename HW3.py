    #         "I already answered that question!‚Äù

    # from the first to the last with each on a single line.  If there are not items in the 
    # answer_history_list it prints "None yet"

    # create the generate_n_responses method
    # it takes as input:
    #    a number, n. Ex: 200
    # it generates a random response n times by calling shake_ball
    # then returns the index and length of the longest consecutive run
    # It should reset the answer_history_list to an empty list first. 
    # A run is a repetition of the same number consecutively in a list.
    # Ex: If 10 random answers are  [1,5,6,3,2,4,1,4,4,4] then three 4's is the longest run
    # hence the function should return "longest run was length of 3 for index 4
